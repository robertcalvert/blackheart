# blackheart

### Written for the [7dfps] challenge 2013

This is blackheart, my attempt at an FPS. It has been a great learning experience working on this project and I have had a lot of fun along the way (and a little stress). Sadly I did not have time to add all the features I would have liked :(

Thank you for looking... I am off to enjoy a beer.

Requires Java or Open JDK 1.7+ to play (It may work on 1.6 but I haven't tested!)

### Dependencies (Not included)

* [LWJGL2]
* [slick-util]
* [JOrbis]
* [progaurd] *(optional)*

Please amend the post scripts as needed.

### Download

All the needful can be found at [blackheart.flob.io]
